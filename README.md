#Amazon Product Data Analysis

This project analyzes an Amazon product dataset "amazon.csv" to understand how discounts, ratings, and sales relate.
The analysis aims to identify trends and insights that can inform pricing and marketing strategies.

#Key Findings

Higher discounts may slightly increase sales, but also increase variability.
Analysis identified top-selling categories, which can inform targeted promotions.

#Recommendations

Prioritize product quality and customer experience.
Target discounts instead of broad promotions.
